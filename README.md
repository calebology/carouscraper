 # Preface
Carousell is a Singaporean smartphone application and web-based marketplace consumer and business to consumer for new and second hand goods. 

# Project Outline
Carouscraper aims to scrape the search results for "Guitar" as a basic exercise of webscraping with BeautifulSoup. Key parameters to be scraped include the product description, price, listing URL and product photos.

The results are then compiled into a file. The goal is for the process to be iterative; the code runs continuously and compiles any new listings onto the same file.
